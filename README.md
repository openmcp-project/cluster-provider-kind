# Cluster Provider kind

## About this project

A cluster provider for OpenMCP that uses [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to provision clusters. Ideal for local development and E2E tests.

## Requirements and Setup

In combination with the [openMCP Operator](https://github.com/openmcp-project/openmcp-operator), this operator can be deployed via a simple k8s resource:
```yaml
apiVersion: openmcp.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterProvider
metadata:
  name: kind
spec:
  image: "ghcr.io/openmcp-project/images/cluster-provider-kind:<latest-version>"
```

To run it locally, run
```shell
go run ./cmd/cluster-provider-kind/main.go init
```
to deploy the CRDs that are required for the operator and then
```shell
go run ./cmd/cluster-provider-kind/main.go run
```

## How it works

In order to create new kind clusters from within a kind cluster, the Docker socket (usually `/var/run/docker.sock`) needs to be available to the `cluster-provider-kind` pod. As a prerequisite, the Docker socket of the host machine must be mounted into the nodes of the platform kind cluster. In this case, there is only a single node (`platform-control-plane`). The socket can then be mounted by the cluster-provider-kind pod using a `hostPath` volume.

subgraph HostMachine
    DockerSocket
    subgraph "platform-control-plane"
        /var/run/docker.sock
        cluster-provider-kind
    end

    DockerSocket -- extraMount --> /var/run/docker.sock
    /var/run/docker.sock -- volumeMount --> cluster-provider-kind

    subgraph mcp-control-plane
        SomeResource
    end

    subgraph mcp-workload
        SomePod
    end

    cluster-provider-kind -- creates --> mcp-control-plane
    cluster-provider-kind -- creates --> mcp-workload
end

```

The kind configuration for the platform cluster may look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
kind: Cluster
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  extraMounts:
  - hostPath: /var/run/docker.sock
    containerPath: /var/run/host-docker.sock
```
 In order to test that the socket is functional, a simple pod can be deployed:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu
spec:
  containers:
  - image: ubuntu
    name: ubuntu
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /var/run/docker.sock
        name: docker
    command:
      - sleep
      - "3600"
  volumes:
    - name: docker
      hostPath:
        path: /var/run/host-docker.sock
        type: Socket
```

After installing docker CLI and kind, it should be possible to create a new kind cluster on the level of the host machine: `kind create cluster --name test`

```
$ kind create cluster --name test

Set kubectl context to "kind-test"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-test

Thanks for using kind! üòä
```

This can be verified by running `kind get clusters` directly on the host machine:

```
$ kind get clusters

platform
test
```
